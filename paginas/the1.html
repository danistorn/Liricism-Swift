    <p>I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit<br>
    Been saying "yes" instead of "no"<br>
    I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though<br>
    I hit the ground running each night<br>
    I hit the Sunday matinée<br>
    You know the greatest films of all time were never made</p>
    
    <p>I guess you never know, never know<br>
    And if you wanted me, you really should've showed<br>
    And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow<br>
    And it's alright now</p>
    
    <p>But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
    Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
    And if my wishes came true<br>
    It would've been you<br>
    In my defense, I have none<br>
    For never leaving well enough alone<br>
    But it would've been fun<br>
    If you would've been the one<br>
    (Ooh)</p>
    
    <p>I have this dream you're doing cool shit<br>
    Having adventures on your own<br>
    You meet some woman on the internet and take her home<br>
    We never painted by the numbers, baby<br>
    But we were making it count<br>
    You know the greatest loves of all time are over now</p>
    
    <p>I guess you never know, never know<br>
    And it's another day waking up alone</p>
    
    <p>But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
    Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
    And if my wishes came true<br>
    It would've been you<br>
    In my defense, I have none<br>
    For never leaving well enough alone<br>
    But it would've been fun<br>
    If you would've been the one</p>
    
    <p>I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you<br>
    If one thing had been different<br>
    Would everything be different today?</p>
    
    <p>We were something, don't you think so?<br>
    Rosé flowing with your chosen family<br>
    And it would've been sweet<br>
    If it could've been me<br>
    In my defense, I have none<br>
    For digging up the grave another time<br>
    But it would've been fun<br>
    If you would've been the one<br>
    (Ooh)</p>
