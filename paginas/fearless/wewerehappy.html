        <div class="letra">

        <p>We used to walk along the streets <br>
        When the porch lights were shinin' bright<br>
        Before I had somewhere to be<br>
        Back when we had all night<br>
        And we were happy<br>
        I do recall a good while back<br>
        We snuck into the circus<br>
        You threw your arms around my neck<br>
        Back when I deserved it<br>
        And we were happy</p>

        <p>When it was good, baby, it was good, baby<br>
        We showed 'em all up<br>
        No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark<br>
        Talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday<br>
        And we were happy</p>

        <p>We used to watch the sun go down<br>
        On the boats in the water<br>
        That's sorta how I feel right now<br>
        And goodbye's so much harder<br>
        'Cause we were happy</p>

        <p>When it was good, baby, it was good, baby<br>
        We showed 'em all up<br>
        No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark<br>
        Talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday<br>
        And we were happy<br>
        We were happy</p>

        <p>Oh, I hate those voices<br>
        Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore<br>
        But they don't give me choices<br>
        And that's what these tears are for<br>
        'Cause we were happy<br>
        We were happy</p>

        <p>When it was good, baby, it was good, baby<br>
        We showed 'em all up<br>
        No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark<br>
        Talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm<br>
        And you were gonna marry me<br>
        And we were happy<br>
        We were happy<br>
        Oh<br>
        We were happy</p>
