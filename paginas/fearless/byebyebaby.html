        <div class="letra">


            <p>It wasn't just like a movie<br>
            The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin<br>
            I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say<br>
            This is the last time I'll drive this way again<br>
            Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray<br>
            'Cause I, I still love you but I can't</p>

            <p>Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side<br>
            Bye, bye, baby<br>
            I want you bad but it's come down to nothing<br>
            And all I have is your sympathy<br>
            'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me<br>
            Bye, bye, baby<br>
            Bye, bye, baby</p>

            <p>The picture frame is empty<br>
            On the dresser, vacant just like me<br>
            I see your writing on the dash<br>
            Then back to your hesitation<br>
            I was so sure of everything<br>
            Everything I thought we'd always have<br>
            Guess I never doubted it<br>
            Then the here and the now floods in<br>
            Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past</p>

            <p>Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side<br>
            Bye, bye, baby<br>
            I want you bad but it's come down to nothing<br>
            And all I have is your sympathy<br>
            'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me<br>
            Bye, bye, baby</p>

            <p>There's so much that I can't touch<br>
            You're all I want but it's not enough this time<br>
            And all the pages are just slipping through my hands<br>
            And I'm so scared of how this ends</p>
            
            <p>Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side<br>
            Bye, bye, baby<br>
            I want you bad but it's come down to nothing<br>
            And all I have is your sympathy<br>
            'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me</p>
            
            <p>Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side<br>
            Bye, bye, baby<br>
            I want you bad but it's come down to nothing<br>
            And all I have is your sympathy<br>
            'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me<br>
            Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me<br>
            Bye, bye, baby<br>
            Bye, bye, baby</p>
