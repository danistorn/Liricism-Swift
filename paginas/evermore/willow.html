        <p>I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night<br>
        Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife<br>
        And if it was an open-shut case<br>
        I never would've known from that look on your face<br>
        Lost in your current like a priceless wine<br>
        The more that you say<br>
        The less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray<br>
        I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans<br>
        That's my man</p>
            
        <p>Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
        Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in<br>
        As if you were a mythical thing<br>
        Like you were a trophy or a champion ring<br>
        And there was one prize I'd cheat to win<br>
        The more that you say<br>
        The less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray<br>
        I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans<br>
        That's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans<br>
        That's my man</p>
            
        <p>Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
        They count me out time and time again<br>
        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
        But I come back stronger than a 90's trend</p>
            
        <p>Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark<br>
        Show me the places where the others gave you scars<br>
        Now this is an open-shut case<br>
        Guess I should've known from the look on your face<br>
        Every bait and switch was a work of art</p>
            
        <p>The more that you say<br>
        The less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray<br>
        I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans<br>
        That's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans<br>
        That's my man</p>
