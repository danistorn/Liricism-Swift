        <span class="titulo">14. Wonderland</span>
            
        <div class="letra">

        <p>Flashing lights and we<br>
        Took a wrong turn and we<br>
        Fell down a rabbit hole<br>
        You held on tight to me<br>
        'Cause nothing's as it seems<br>
        And spinning out of control<br>
        Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?<br>
        Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?<br>
        Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?<br>
        Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?<br>
        I felt your arms twisting around me<br>
        I should've slept with one eye open at night</p>
            
        <p>We found Wonderland<br>
        You and I got lost in it<br>
        And we pretended it could last forever, eh, eh<br>
        We found Wonderland<br>
        You and I got lost in it<br>
        And life was never worse but never better, eh, eh<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland</p>
            
        <p>So we went on our way<br>
        Too in love to think straight<br>
        All alone, or so it seemed<br>
        But there were strangers watching<br>
        And whispers turned to talking<br>
        And talking turned to screams, oh</p>
            
        <p>Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?<br>
        Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?<br>
        Didn't you call my fears with a Cheshire Cat smile?<br>
        Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?<br>
        I felt your arms twisting around me<br>
        It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind</p>
            
        <p>Oh, darling, we found Wonderland<br>
        You and I got lost in it<br>
        And we pretended it could last forever, eh, eh<br>
        We found Wonderland<br>
        You and I got lost in it<br>
        And life was never worse but never better, eh, eh<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland<br>
        (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland</p>
            
        <p>I reached for you<br>
        But you were gone<br>
        I knew I had to go back home<br>
        You search the world for something else<br>
        To make you feel like what we had<br>
        And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad</p>
            
        <p>Oh, we found Wonderland<br>
        You and I got lost in it<br>
        And we pretended it could last forever, eh, eh (last forever)<br>
        We found Wonderland<br>
        You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)<br>
        And life was never worse but never better, eh, eh (never better)<br>
        We found Wonderland (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)<br>
        You and I got lost in it (in Wonderland)<br>
        And we pretended it (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)<br>
        Could last forever (in Wonderland)<br>
        We found Wonderland (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)<br>
        You and I got lost in it (in Wonderland)<br>
        And life was never worse but never better (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)<br>
        In Wonderland</p>
