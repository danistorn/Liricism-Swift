<p>He did it<br>
He did it</p>
	
<p>Este's a friend of mine<br>
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine<br>
Este's been losing sleep<br>
Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity<br>
She says, "That ain't my merlot on his mouth"<br>
"That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"<br>
No, there ain't no doubt<br>
I think I'm gonna call him out<br>
She says</p>

<p>"I think he did it but I just can't prove it"<br>
I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
No, no body, no crime<br>
But I ain't letting up until the day I die<br>
No, no<br>
I think he did it<br>
No, no<br>
He did it</p>

<p>Este wasn't there<br>
Tuesday night at Olive Garden, at her job, or anywhere<br>
He reports his missing wife<br>
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires<br>
And his mistress moved in<br>
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything<br>
No, there ain't no doubt<br>
Somebody's gotta catch him out<br>
'Cause</p>

<p>I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)<br>
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)<br>
I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
No, no body, no crime<br>
But I ain't letting up until the day I die<br>
No, no<br>
I think he did it<br>
No, no<br>
He did it</p>

<p>Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen<br>
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene<br>
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")<br>
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy</p>

<p>They think she did it but they just can't prove it<br>
They think she did it but they just can't prove it<br>
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it<br>
No, no body, no crime<br>
I wasn't letting up until the day he<br>
No, no body, no crime<br>
I wasn't letting up until the day he<br>
No, no body, no crime<br>
I wasn't letting up until the day he died</p>
